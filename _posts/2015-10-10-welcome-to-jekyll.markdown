Hello there, just going to briefly describe this transition before describing myself in a later post. 

As I'm writing this, everything is barebones jekyll. I've been using a grunt workflow for a standard website with wordpress. There was no real use of ruby or github, just pure Node.js and Dreamweaver. 

In creating this site, I hope to understand the deal with preprocessors concerning the popular use of SASS and CoffeeScript. I've always figured that being fluent in foundational CSS, HTML and JS is better than learning SASS, Markdown, Jquery etc. Often when asking what skills other web designers have, that are roughly my age or below, there are misconceptions that being good at Jquery is equivalent to understanding Javascript.

Discovering grunt has set me on the path to jekyll, yeoman ruby and python. Follow me as my site develops and my skills are cultivated.
